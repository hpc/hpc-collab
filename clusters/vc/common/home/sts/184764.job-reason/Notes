hypothetical reproducer:
 1. set license count to 0
     sacctmgr -iQ modify resource name=homevagrant server=slurmdb set count=0

 2. set shared partition to down
     scontrol update partition=shared state=down

 3. submit jobs of varying priority, with user holds, show queue & date on each step completion
    a. use multiple user ids to get a spread of priority & fairshare history
    b. ensure that the accumulated jobs' requested time total > calculated start time limit (24 hours)
    c. release holds on user jobs
    d. force a scheduler cycle, if necessary
    e. reset license counter to non-zero
       sacctmgr -iQ modify resource name=homevagrant server=slurmdb set count=4 ; squeue
    f. set shared partition to up
        scontrol update partition=shared state=state
    g. monitor (short time cycle?) queue until empty
 
4. refinement/complication/realism
    background processes: a. flip the shared partition up and down
                          b. flip the homevagrant license count between 0 and non-zero
