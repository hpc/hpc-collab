1. main driver sits in top-level directory
   creates structure skeletons for jobs(?)
   walks sub-directories which contain a Makefile
   increases slurm debug flags
   inserts marker into syslog, possibly slurm log
   
2. sub-directories fill up the queue according to their own pattern
   run qstats: bin/qstats.sh [-D] [-V] -P -R, possibly qstats.sh [-D] -t
   without "-D -V", attributes flow to syslog as "shell-like parameters"
   with "-D -V", attributes flow to stdout as CSV

3. top-level collector runs and collects time-stamped CSV output,
   inserts end marker into syslog, possibly slurm log
   resets slurm debug flags back to normal
 
4. collects slurm logs & queue CSV data => timestamped tarball
